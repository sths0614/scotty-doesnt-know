##The advanced Topics we covered are:##
#Particle effects (in the exhaust for the ship)#
#Bump mapping (for all the objects)#
#Collision detection (for asteroids)#
#Physics (implemented gravity for spaceship)#

#The game objective is to survive as long as possible without hitting any asteroids or leaving the orbit by flying too high or too low.#
#Your two choices are to avoid the asteroids or to blow them up, but you get a limited number of missiles to destroy asteroids with.#

##Controls:##
#Press down the space bar constantly to use the thrusters#
#Scream to shoot the missiles#

#Hope you guys have as much fun playing as we did making it! :)#
